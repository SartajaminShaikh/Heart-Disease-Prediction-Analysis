#❤️ CardioInsight – Heart Disease Prediction & Analytics System










📋 Overview

CardioInsight is a Heart Disease Prediction and Analytics System built using Python and Machine Learning.
The project analyzes clinical and demographic patient data to predict the presence or absence of heart disease and identify key medical risk factors.

It combines Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), data visualization, and machine learning models to provide accurate predictions and meaningful healthcare insights.
